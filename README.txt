Jlibfprint was developed as part of a small project during our studies
at the University of Naples (Universit√† degli studi di Napoli Federico II).
It was not developed in the sight to provide a full support to 
the fingerprint sensors under Linux, but just as basic access to these 
peripherals under Java.

We are sharing the code in the hope that it can be enough for your 
purposes or at least can just be a good starting point to extend 
the integration of Java with the libfprint library.

This project is fully independent from our university and from 
the libfprint project. We want thank all the authors of libfprint
for their contribution to the open source world on top of which
our small software bridge is collocated.

INSTALLATION
------------

The Jlibfprint is a JNI bridge to libfprint, so it is strictly dependent
from that library. We used for our testing the libfprint-0.4.0 and we will 
refer to that version in the next of these instructions.

Jlibfprint is divided in two folder: JlibFprint, JlibFprint_jni. 
The first one contains for now only the Java class used for the bridging
with the native library, the second one is the dynamic library used by JNI.

1. Download the (latest) sources of libfprint 

2. To give the ability to compare two fingerprint data in Jlibfprint 
	you probabily need to patch the library in this way:
		- in libfprint find the file img.c and open it
		- find the function 
	int fpi_img_compare_print_data(struct fp_print_data *enrolled_print,
		struct fp_print_data *new_print)
		- add the attribute "API_EXPORTED" before the definition of the function:
	API_EXPORTED int fpi_img_compare_print_data(struct fp_print_data *enrolled_print,
		struct fp_print_data *new_print)
		
3. Configure, compile and install libfprint in the library folder your system use for dynamic linking.

4. Open the jlibfprint_jni/Makefile file, search for the ADD_INCLUDE variable (near line 53),
	and specify the JDK include library and the path of the source files of the libfprint 
	you have just patched. Please take care to add also this subfolder: libfprint/nbis/include.
	
5. Compile the JNI bridge with a "make all"

6. Copy the dynamic library you just compiled from the subdirectory of the "dist" folder
	to a lib system library used for dynamic linking.
	
7. Now you can use the class jlibfprint.JlibFprint in JlibFprint for your Java applications.
	You can soon test the library running the jlibfprint.SampleRun class. 
	If you want, you can put those classes into a Jar file. It is likely that you find that Jar 
	into JlibFprint/dist.
